# ðŸŽž Fuji Film Simulation Creative Profiles for Sony A7C Mark II

This repository provides a set of **Fujifilm-style film simulations** as `.dcp` Creative Profiles, adapted for use on **Sony A7C II** RAW files. These profiles replicate popular Fuji film looksâ€”**Provia, Velvia, Astia, Classic Chrome, Pro Neg Std, Pro Neg Hi, Eterna**â€”by injecting their color rendering style while preserving your Sony cameraâ€™s native color accuracy.

*Note: This only works on RAW files.*

These profiles:
- Apply Fujifilm's LookTable and ToneCurve on top of your Sony RAWs
- Preserve Sonyâ€™s native sensor matrices for correct color science
- Show up in **Adobe Camera Raw / Lightroom Classic** as **Creative profiles**
- No EXIF spoofing, no sensor mismatch.
